Changed the source code to view the website to meet accessibility standards
    -Included id="search-engine-optimization" to view source in line 32

Included Alt attributes to provide an alternate text for all images 
    -The value of the alt attribute describes the image

Adhered to the **Scout Rule**&mdash; and left the code a little cleaner than when I found it
